Phantasy Star Online Version 2 for PC

The files that we are interested in is the *n.rel files in the STAGE folder.

n.rel files are pretty much packaged NJCM files into a wrapper, possibly with
additional information for actions that take place inside the game such as foot
steps or shadows. I have not confirmed this personally, I'm generally taking a
guess as to what information is in the file that is not model information.

Start by going to the end of the file -16 bytes
There is a pointer to the head of the file.


typedef struct {

} NJS_MAP_SECTION

typedef struct {

} NJS_TEXTURE_LIST

typedef struct {
  unsigned int num_sections;
  unsigned int magic_number; //..HD
  NJS_MAP_SECTION** map_section;
  NJS_TEXTURE_LIST*
} NJS_STAGE_HEADER
